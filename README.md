This package allows you to `mute` and `unmute` a specific observer at will. It ships with a trait that adds mutable methods to your observer.

## Installation

Run the following command:

```bash
composer require akaunting/laravel-mutable-observer
```

## Usage

All you have to do is use the `Mutable` trait inside your observer.

```php
namespace App\Observers;

use Akaunting\MutableObserver\Traits\Mutable;

class UserObserver
{
    use Mutable;
}
```

Now you can `mute` and `unmute` the observer as needed:

```php
UserObserver::mute();

// Some logic, i.e. test

UserObserver::unmute();
```
